        <h3>WHAT</h3>
        <br />
        <p><b>KNXlevelUP</b> system is our know how: package of industrial PLC with software core Codesys in
            conjunction
            with visualization server <a href="http://iridi.com/">Iridium</a> with frontend and backend on JS code is a
            flexible and powerfull system with many features that can fulfill any wishes in automation. </p>
        <br />
        <h3>HOW</h3>
        <br />
        <p>- industrial PLC enables us to create failsafe systems with increased reliability, which processes scenario
            logic with
            unlimited duration. PLC with KNX inteface is original KNX device give you advantage of KNX technology.
            <br />
            - <a href="http://iridi.com/">Iridium</a> visualization server in different hardware implementation enables
            us to
            create functionally and graphically tailor-made HMI,
            at the same time providing data firewall between KNX, Modbus TCP and AV/HTTP systems and allows to control
            any
            IP devices with multi-language interface. Also we build different task on it: BYOD, MS Exchange
            integration, security and control system.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>KEY FUNCTIONS</h3>
        <br />
        <p>- <b> Business Rules Engine (BRE)</b> is KNXlevelUP module, which enables to separate all dependencies,
            procedures and scenarios into a standalone software or hardware module: simplifies and increases control
            quality of various modes and scenarios. *

                - modular PLC is used as an interface between various engineering systems, which operate on different
                physical
                buses: KNX, DALI, Modbus, RS-485, LONbus, BACnet and others.

                        <p>- <b>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)</b> system is essential technology for residential and
                            commercial spaces based on
                            Iridium visualization.
                            It enables use of visualization with limitations by roles and duration on any smartphone or
                            tablets (for example,
                            guest in a hotel room and use of conference room or mansions) on the fly. If you book
                            meeting room, you can have visualization to control only this room during your reservation.
